# Long-term plans

Long term would like to end up with applied physiology lab
Want to study more than individual folk
Epidemiology to test for mechanisms in larger populations
Professor/attending in medicine/cardiology

# Central hypothesis

Autonomic dysfunction leads to decrease in VFT
	Likely autonomic (e.g. circadian pattern)
	SCD risk remains large/unexplained
No known mechanisms or methods to identify patients at risk
No interventions (outside of ICDs) to intervene

# Steps forward

## R series

Epi studies to identify patients with worse outcomes
Study effect of interventions on overall outcomes
Applied physiology to study stress reactivity

## K grant

Applied physiology studies
Focus on HRV/ECG findings and stress reactivity

## F grant

Need tangible/incremental specific aims
Don't make it too "big",
	- incorporating projects with MSNA may be overwhelming
Needs to be with an R01-funded mentor

### Brainstorming

- measure alternative ECG markers and compare with MSNA data
- use machine learning algorithm to compare ECG data with gold standard of MSNA data... feature identification
- GEH maybe helpful, more as an acute marker than as a chronic marker
- compare mental stress to ECG and MSNA data?
- stress reactivity index of some kind
- occlusion plethysmography as surrogate SNS tone

### What is the story of the F32?

Have 2 years of funding
Work with EPICORE group
	But also dabble in applied physiology and computational bioinformatics
Goal is to be academic cardiologist studying autonomic dysfunction
Detecting non-invasive surrogates for worse outcomes / autonomic risk

### Specific Aims

#### Background

Psychological stress is bad.
	Likely due to changes in sympathovagal balance
	Vagal withdrawal increases risk
	High sympathetic tone increases risk
ANS function can be quantified in several ways
	Invasive/extensive
		MSNA
		Reactive hyperemia 
		Venous adrenergic
	Non-invasive
		ECG morphology (T wave area, 
		Time-independent HRV (e.g. geometric, PSA)
		Time-dependent HRV (e.g. HRT, Dyx)
Quantification of ANS tone
	Identifying ANS tone can identify at-risk individuals
	Can also test if treatment/interventions are successful
Importance
	Few studies look at MSNA and ECG findings in real-time?

#### Hypothesis

[I hypothesize that disturbances of the neurocardiac axis, assessed by
both heart and brain metrics, associate with autonomic dysfunction,
which can be measured by *Dyx*]{.underline}. As such, Dyx is a useful
metric in both efforts to risk stratify for CAD, as well as detect
neurovisceral dysfunction. We propose to study *Dyx* by measuring HRV
through ambulatory ECG patches (BioStampÂ®, MC10 Inc.) in subjects with
chronic stable angina undergoing evaluation in the Emory Cardiovascular
Biobank. The Biobank is a prospective cohort study of individuals
undergoing clinically indicated cardiac catherization in which conducts
validated neuropsychological assessments are also made.^18^ The data we
collect from this proposal will allow us to assess the relationship
between autonomic function, neuropsychiatric status, and cardiac
catherization. Our aims are:

#### Aims


1.  **To determine the effect of neuropsychiatric disturbances, as
    determined by depressed mood and cognitive impairment, on autonomic
    dysfunction.** *[Hypothesis]{.underline}: (A) High levels of
    depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), and (B)
    cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) will be
    associated with low Dyx.*

2.  **To evaluate the relationship of autonomic dysfunction, measured by
    abnormal HRV, to the spectrum of progressive CAD.**
    *[Hypothesis]{.underline}:* *Low Dyx (\<2.0 units) in the morning
    hours associates with an increased odds of finding obstructive CAD
    (stenosis [\>]{.underline} 70%). When evaluated as a continuous
    exposure, Dyx negatively associates with CAD plaque burden (Gensini
    score) in a dose-response relationship.*^19^

Determine relationship between MSNA and ECG findings during mental stress.
	P-wave morphology
	GEH
	TWA
Measure correlation of MSNA with other non-invasive measures of autonomic tone
	SKNA
	VOP
	ML to detect ECG features that associate with MSNA

ECG data and cardiac catherization
	Have already enrolled ~ 200 patients
	Will have up to 2 years of data follow-up and outcomes
	Refine feature analysis and algorithm to detect CAD
	Add retrospective data on prior stress test (heavy chart review)
	Add machine learning or digital signal processing coursework
MSNA and ECG clinical outcomes
	MSNA data has been collected with Jeanie Park
