# Long-term plans

Long term would like to end up with applied physiology lab
Want to study more than individual folk
Epidemiology to test for mechanisms in larger populations
Professor/attending in medicine/cardiology

# Central hypothesis

Autonomic dysfunction leads to decrease in VFT
	Likely autonomic (e.g. circadian pattern)
	SCD risk remains large/unexplained
No known mechanisms or methods to identify patients at risk
No interventions (outside of ICDs) to intervene

# Steps forward

## R series

Epi studies to identify patients with worse outcomes
Study effect of interventions on overall outcomes
Applied physiology to study stress reactivity

## K grant

Applied physiology studies
Focus on HRV/ECG findings and stress reactivity

## F grant

Need tangible/incremental specific aims
Potential ideas
- measure alternative ECG markers and compare with MSNA data
- use machine learning algorithm to compare ECG data with gold standard of MSNA data... feature identification
- GEH maybe helpful, more as an acute marker than as a chronic marker
- compare mental stress to ECG and MSNA data?
- stress reactivity index of some kind
- occlusion plethysmography as surrogate SNS tone
